```

### Command Line Version

```bash
python local2stream_cli.py
```

### Using the GUI

1. **Select Music Directory**: Click "Browse" to choose your music folder
2. **Enter Playlist Name**: Choose a name for your new Spotify playlist
3. **Enter Spotify Credentials**: 
   - Input your Spotify Client ID
   - Input your Spotify Client Secret (hidden for security)

## GUI Features 🖥️

### Main Interface Elements

- **Music Directory Selection**: Browse and select your music folder
- **Playlist Configuration**: Set your desired playlist name
- **Spotify Authentication**: Secure credential input with password masking
- **Real-time Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator
- **Live Logging**: Detailed process logs with colored status indicators

### Progress Indicators

- 📁 Directory scanning
- 🎵 File discovery
- 🔍 Track searching
- ✅ Successful matches
- ❌ Failed matches
- 🎉 Completion summary

## How It Works 🔍

### Metadata Extraction
- Extracts metadata from audio file tags (ID3, FLAC, MP4)
- Falls back to filename parsing if metadata is missing
- Supports common filename formats like "Artist - Title"

### Intelligent Matching
1. **Exact Match**: Direct title and artist matching
2. **Fuzzy Match**: Similarity-based matching with confidence scores
3. **Title-Only Search**: When artist information is unavailable
4. **Artist Fallback**: Search by artist, then match titles

### Match Types in GUI
- **[Exact]**: Perfect title and artist match
- **[Fuzzy]**: High similarity match with confidence scoring
- **[Title Only]**: Match based on title when artist is unavailable
- **[Artist Fallback]**: Found through artist search with title matching

## Supported Audio Formats 🎵

| Format | Extension | Metadata Support |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| MP3    | `.mp3`    | ✅ ID3 tags      |
| FLAC   | `.flac`   | ✅ Vorbis tags   |
| M4A/MP4| `.m4a`, `.mp4` | ✅ iTunes tags |
| WAV    | `.wav`    | ⚠️ Filename only |
| OGG    | `.ogg`    | ⚠️ Filename only |

## Example GUI Output 📈

```
